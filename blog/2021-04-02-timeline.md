## Events

### 1.) Crowdpooling campaign on DODO
The initial token distribution will take place through a fair crowdpooling campaign on DODO. For this purpose, 800,000 tokens will be minted and offered for purchase by the community.

Crowdpooling has some advantages over traditional liquidity offerings like Bonding Curve, Auction or AMM on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
- Prevents Frontrunning - all participants pay the same price.
- No need to inflate the token supply in circulation to bootstrap temporary liquidity.
- The immediate end result of Crowdpooling is a trading pair with sufficient liquidity.
- Raised amount from Crowdpooling participants can't be misused and is used to create a liquidity market.
- It builds a solid foundation for future influx of interest and capital, even if the bid size is small.

After the conclusion of the Crowdpooling campaign, $DKA tokens will be immediately claimable. DODO will then make the DKA/BUSD trading pair available for public trading.

:::danger NOTE

After another security audit we have decided to remove the minting function from the token smart contract. This will result in the DODO liquidity pool becoming invalid. Please do not buy any more tokens from this pool. We have created a liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. All holders who have claimed there tokens have already received the new tokens at the same address. If you have not yet claimed your tokens please write to us on our social media channels and you will receive the new tokens in less than 24 hours.

### 2.) dApp Launch & 100,000 $DKA Mining Program
Over 100,000 $DKA tokens are up for grabs through the DEKA Mining Program. Here is how to participate.

For each day you are staked or adding liquidity, you will earn DEKA point. The points you earn are redeemable for $DKA at the end of the mining program, proportional to your ownership of the points. Hereâ€™s an example:

If there are 1,000,000 points earned by all participants and you earned 50,000 points, you account for 5% of the total points. You would receive 5,000 $DKA at the end of thirty days.

To earn DEKA points, you can do one of the three following things.
- **1.25x Multiplier**: Users who stake for a minimum of 30 days on the dApp.
- **2x Multiplier**: Users who add BNB/DKA, BUSD/DKA liquidity to the DEKA liquidity pool
- **4x Multiplier**: Users who add BNB/DKA, BUSD/DKA liquidity to https://app.deka.finance/pool

A daily snapshot will be taken of all holders. After 1 month, users will be able to redeem their earned $DKA. The program will start the day that the dApp launches.

More detailed information will be announced as soon as possible.
